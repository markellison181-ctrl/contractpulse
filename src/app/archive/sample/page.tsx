            DoD IT Modernization Investment Reaches $15B, Reshaping Defense Contracting
          </h2>
          <div className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p>
              The Department of Defense has announced the largest IT modernization investment 
              in over a decade, with <strong className="text-white">$15 billion allocated</strong> for 
              fiscal year 2026 across cloud migration, cybersecurity upgrades, and AI implementation. 
              This surge represents a 35% increase from FY2025 and signals DoD&apos;s commitment to 
              technology transformation across all branches.
            </p>
            <p>
              The investment spans multiple procurement vehicles: $4.2B through GSA&apos;s Enterprise 
              Infrastructure Solutions (EIS), $3.8B via the Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO) 
              contracts, and $2.1B through new AI-focused SEWP VI task orders. The Pentagon is 
              also launching three new indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts 
              specifically for cybersecurity mesh architecture and zero-trust implementations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-gold">Why it matters:</strong> This isn&apos;t just about DoD — 
              civilian agencies are watching these implementations closely. Technologies proven in 
              defense environments often become the standard for Department of Veterans Affairs, 
              Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies. Early performers in DoD&apos;s IT 
              modernization will have significant advantages in the broader federal market.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-gold">What to do:</strong> (1) Review your SAM.gov profile 
              for relevant NAICS codes (518210, 541511, 541512). (2) Monitor GSA&apos;s EIS portal 
              for new task orders. (3) Attend DoD&apos;s &quot;Industry Day&quot; webinars on AI and 
              cybersecurity (March 15-17). (4) Ensure your company has appropriate security clearance 
              processing pipelines — many awards require Secret clearance within 90 days.

              GSA&apos;s updated cybersecurity requirements for IT services contracts take effect 
              March 1, 2026. All contractors providing IT services to federal agencies must 
              now demonstrate compliance with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and maintain 
              FedRAMP authorization for any cloud-based deliverables. Existing contractors have 
              90 days to achieve compliance or risk contract modification or termination. This

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              The Small Business Administration raised the small business set-aside threshold 
              for construction contracts from $7M to $10M, effective immediately. This change 
              expands the universe of construction projects available exclusively to small 
              businesses and is expected to increase small business construction contracting 
              by an estimated $2.1B annually. The increase applies to all federal agencies 
              and aligns with inflation adjustments recommended in the 2026 NDAA.

              The Biden Administration expanded Buy America requirements to include IT hardware 
              purchases over $10,000. Federal agencies must now prioritize domestically manufactured 
              servers, networking equipment, and end-user devices. The policy includes a waiver 
              process for unavailable items, but agencies must justify non-compliance. This 
              significantly impacts GSA Technology and NIH CIO-SP3 contract vehicles, with 
              compliance required for all new task orders issued after April 1, 2026.
