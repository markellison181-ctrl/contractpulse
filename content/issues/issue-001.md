## 🏆 Top 5 Contract Awards This Week

### 1. Lockheed Martin — $2.4B | Dept. of Defense (Navy)
**Next-generation integrated combat system modernization** for Aegis-class destroyers. Multi-year IDIQ with options through FY2031. Awarded via sole-source under FAR 6.302-1 (only responsible source). Work to be performed in Moorestown, NJ and Huntsville, AL.

### 2. Leidos — $1.8B | Dept. of Homeland Security
**Enterprise IT infrastructure modernization** across DHS component agencies. Full and open competition; 7 bidders. 5-year base with two 3-year option periods. Replaces incumbent Perspecta (now part of Peraton). Significant cloud migration component targeting FedRAMP High.

### 3. Booz Allen Hamilton — $980M | Dept. of Veterans Affairs
**Health data analytics and AI platform** supporting VA electronic health records and predictive care models. Task order under the T4NG GWAC. Notable for explicit AI/ML requirements in the SOW — a growing trend across civilian agencies.

### 5. Palantir Technologies — $480M | Dept. of Defense (Army)

## 🔍 Signal of the Week: The VA's $980M Bet on AI-Driven Healthcare

The VA's award to Booz Allen Hamilton isn't just another IT contract — it signals a fundamental shift in how the federal government procures AI capabilities.

**Why it matters:**

- **First major VA contract with "AI-native" requirements.** The SOW explicitly requires machine learning models for patient readmission prediction, drug interaction screening, and resource allocation optimization — not as a nice-to-have, but as core deliverables with measurable accuracy benchmarks.

- **The Oracle Cerner pivot.** This award comes as the VA continues its troubled transition from VistA to Oracle Cerner's health records system. The analytics platform is designed to sit *on top of* whichever EHR system is in use, suggesting the VA is hedging its bets on the underlying infrastructure while investing in the intelligence layer.

- **Pricing structure is novel.** Rather than traditional T&M or FFP, the contract uses a hybrid model: fixed-price for platform development milestones, with outcome-based incentive fees tied to measurable improvements in patient outcomes (30-day readmission rates, appointment no-show reduction). This is rare in federal contracting and could become a template.

- **Implications for competitors.** Palantir, which has aggressively pursued VA work, was notably absent from the competitive range. Sources suggest the VA specifically excluded platforms requiring proprietary data formats — a direct shot at Palantir's Foundry architecture.

**What to watch:** The GAO protest window closes March 10. If no protest is filed, expect a rapid ramp-up with initial operating capability targeted for Q4 FY2026.

## 💡 Contracting Trends to Track

**DOGE-adjacent spending freezes are thawing.** After a turbulent start to FY2026 with blanket spending reviews, obligation velocity has picked up sharply in February. Agencies appear to be rushing to obligate funds before potential continuing resolution complications in Q3. Expect a surge in March award activity.

**AI is now a standalone NAICS consideration.** The Office of Management and Budget's recent guidance directing agencies to create AI-specific contract line items (CLINs) rather than burying AI deliverables within broader IT contracts is starting to show up in solicitations. Track NAICS 541715 (R&D in Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) for AI-specific opportunities.
