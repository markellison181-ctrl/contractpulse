### 📡 Signal of the Week

**DOJ Expands Health Care for Federal Prisoners — $47.8M to Heritage Health Solutions**

The U.S. Marshals Service just awarded a $47.8M contract to Heritage Health Solutions for nationwide prisoner healthcare delivery. This isn't a new concept — but the scale signals a broader trend: federal agencies are increasingly outsourcing complex healthcare operations to specialized vendors.

If you're in healthcare services, correctional health, or managed care, USMS is actively buying. The incumbent (Heritage) has held this contract since October 2025, but recompetes are coming.

**Why it matters:** Healthcare services contracts across DOJ, DHS, and VA represent a growing $5B+ annual market. Agencies need specialized providers, and the barrier to entry is lower than you'd think for firms with clinical capacity.

### 🏆 Top Awards This Week

| Vendor | Agency | Amount | What |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Perimeter Solutions LP | USDA | $50.0M | Fire retardant services for 2026 wildfire season |
| Network Designs Inc. | DOJ | $48.6M | IT services (SDVOSB set-aside) |

| HII Mission Technologies | GSA | $47.5M | F-16 maintenance training |
| Triple Canopy Inc. | DHS | $47.3M | Protective security officers |

**Pattern to watch:** Three of the seven are services contracts — IT, security, healthcare. Hardware is flat. Services are growing.

### ⚖️ Policy Watch

**DOGE Impact on Federal Contracting**

The Department of Government Efficiency continues to drive procurement reform conversations. Key developments:

- **Accelerated contract review cycles** — agencies being pushed to justify renewals earlier
- **Increased scrutiny on sole-source awards** — expect more competitive procurements
- **IT modernization mandates** — cloud-first policies creating new opportunities for mid-market tech firms

**What to do:** If you have a current contract, document your ROI metrics now. Agencies will need to justify every dollar, and vendors who make that case easy will survive the review cycle.
